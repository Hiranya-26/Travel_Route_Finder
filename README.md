# 🗺️ Travel Route Finder (Prolog – DFS, BFS, A*)

A simple route-finding system built using **SWI-Prolog** that finds paths between locations using classic AI search algorithms:  
**Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A\* Search**.

This project demonstrates how graph-based pathfinding and search strategies work in Prolog using real-world inspired locations.

## 🚀 What This Project Does

- Models a small travel map as a **weighted, undirected graph**
- Finds possible routes between two locations
- Calculates the **total distance (cost)** of each route
- Compares different search strategies:
  - DFS – explores deeply
  - BFS – finds the shortest path by number of steps
  - A* – finds the optimal path using heuristics

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1️⃣ Install SWI-Prolog  
Download and install from:  
https://www.swi-prolog.org

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository

### 3️⃣ Run in SWI-Prolog 

---Load the file by ?- [travel].
---Then you can find routes by ?- find_best_route(kandy, digana). <---- Just an example.
